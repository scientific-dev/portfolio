# My Portfolio

My personal website describing about me. A very responsive mobile friendly frontend svelte website.

**Link:** https://scientific-guy.is-a.dev/<br/>

The old site which used react as its DOM is been shifted to [react-old](https://github.com/Scientific-Guy/portfolio/tree/react-old) branch for references, the current website is written in Svelte.

Any kind of suggestions, bugs or doubts create an issue here!
