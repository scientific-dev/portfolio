# My Portfolio

My personal website describing about me. A very responsive mobile friendly frontend svelte website.

**Link:** https://thesudarsandev.xyz/<br/>
**Discord:** https://discord.gg/qFNwUNpSx8

The old site which used react as its DOM is shifted to [react-old](https://github.com/scientific-dev/portfolio/tree/react-old) branch and the old svelte site is shifted to [svelte-old](https://github.com/scientific-dev/portfolio/tree/svelete-old) branch for references.

Any kind of suggestions, bugs or doubts create an issue here!
